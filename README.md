- 👋 Hi, I’m @Unorthodocs
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of tech related things but narrow my research down to specific things that I find interesting or on projects I decide I want to mess with.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more than I should be in one sitting.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. I am still in my learning phase and working on multiple projects to familiarize myself with things.
- 📫 How to reach me: Will update later.
